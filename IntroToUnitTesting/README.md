**Assignment Learning Goals Summary:**

This assignment focuses on developing effective unit tests using JUnit for the Demo class. The main learning goals include:

1. **Unit Testing with JUnit:** Gain proficiency in building JUnit tests for Java code, specifically for the Demo class.

2. **Mutation Analysis:** Understand and apply mutation analysis to evaluate the adequacy of unit tests. This involves testing variations of the Demo.java file, each with a single fault introduced, to ensure robust test coverage.

3. **Java Development:** Apply Java programming skills to create `DemoTest.java` for testing the Demo class.

4. **Build Automation with Gradle:** Learn to use Gradle for project building and task automation. Understand how to import the project into Eclipse, build it from the command line, and run tests.

5. **Environment Setup:** Acquire skills in setting up the development environment, including installing Java 8 JDK, managing dependencies with Gradle, and addressing potential issues with Java versions and display configurations.

6. **Self-Guided Learning:** Develop the ability to navigate and explore a project independently. Learn to use the Eclipse IDE and execute commands from the command line for project building.

This assignment provides a hands-on experience to enhance proficiency in Java development, testing methodologies, build automation, and independent problem-solving.
